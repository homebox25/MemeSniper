# MemeSniper
A simple bot that monitors the Solana blockchain and Pump.fun website for new MemeCoins, and attempts to apply basic heuristics in order to predict which ones will moon. Work in progress, intended for educational use only. 

PLANNED FEATURES/UPDATES

-Once heuristic checks and buy/sell logic is completed, convert code to C++ for lower latency
-Utilize DPDK for lower latency
-Write script to tune Linux kernel parameters/NUMA nodes
-Machine learning model to better predict prices
  -Ideally something lightweight for latency
